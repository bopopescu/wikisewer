- get some AJAX handling the updates.

- folksonomy, tagging (political, sexual, prurient, personal/inside)
	+almost there but i suspect a problem with the request form handler.
	+the form getter isn't picking anything up.
	+okay, well we've got one tag coming across, form data accomplished.
	+need to understand pushing and appending list items to record (storing and updating lists in mongo) 


- Give users the ability to build a query (or just have some basic queries there)

- make it automatic, single process from gathering to display (need to better understand how the collections will interact and grow) - Or just run from cron at normal intervals.

- better styling 

- do something with this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:<all the files go here>

- long-polling

-DONE- mark already scraped??

-DONE- add date
	* what's up with the Year being out of range?
	 ---that was for converting UNIX time to date time, forget it, we'll store the datetime from the beginning

-DONE- there is no user page for anonymous users, use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/<IP Address> template here. (will require reg-ex in flask)

-DONE- Give it the power to vote - vote on what? Not a crucial element, wouldn't really add that much value, but of course it's more a learning exercise for myself. Nobody is going to use this site. (Note: increments votes, but this needs to be far more sophisticated)
