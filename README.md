This is primarily a copy of Ed Summers' [Wikistream](https://github.com/edsu/wikistream), modified in layout and just adding a sprig of difference to the backend to only output vandalism as it is reverted on wikipedia.

The concept behind this exercise being 1) that I am educating myself on a node app to plumb wikipedia and 2) that i am interested in drudging up the slime that otherwise gets quickly wetted down on wikipedia. A bit of pathos for the ephemeral, potty-mouthed underbelly of the wikibeast.
